# Alarm_clock
The Interactive Alarm Clock Page is a front-end coding project designed as a skill test for the Coding Ninjas Full Stack Development course. This project challenges aspiring developers to create a user-friendly web page that emulates the functionality of a digital alarm clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Key Features:

Time Display: The page should prominently display the current time, updating in real-time.
Alarm Set and Display: Users can set alarms by specifying the desired time and have these alarms displayed.
Alarm Sound: When an alarm time is reached, an audible sound should play to notify the user.
Alarm Controls: Users can start, stop, or delete alarms as needed.


The project should demonstrate proficiency in HTML for structuring the page, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for real-time functionality. It assesses the ability to create an interactive and visually appealing user interface while handling real-time clock operations and event handling.
